<h1>About</h1>
<br>
The Cab Management System is a comprehensive application developed to automate and optimize the process of booking and managing cab rides. Users can easily register, log in, and book rides by entering their pickup and drop-off locations. The system checks for available cabs in real-time and assigns a driver accordingly. Drivers receive ride requests and can update their availability status.

The system includes real-time tracking of rides, providing passengers with the estimated time of arrival and fare calculations. Multiple payment options are integrated for a smooth transaction experience. The admin dashboard allows administrators to oversee the entire system, manage users, and generate reports.

Additionally, the system features a robust feedback mechanism where passengers and drivers can rate and review each other, ensuring high service standards. Notifications and alerts keep all users informed about ride statuses and updates.

This project is built using Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, and other technologies, ensuring a scalable and maintainable solution for cab management.
